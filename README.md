## Solving LeetCode Questions Easily

### Problem-Solving Techniques

1. **Brute Force:**
   - Start with the simplest approach by trying all possible solutions.
   - Useful for small input sizes.

2. **Two Pointers:**
   - Use two pointers to iterate from different directions.
   - Useful for problems involving arrays or linked lists.

3. **Sliding Window:**
   - Maintain a window of elements to solve problems involving subarrays or substrings.
   - Useful for problems requiring optimization within a range.

4. **Divide and Conquer:**
   - Break the problem into smaller subproblems, solve them independently, and combine the results.
   - Useful for problems involving recursion or tree structures.

5. **Dynamic Programming:**
   - Store the results of subproblems to avoid redundant computations.
   - Useful for optimization problems, especially those involving sequences or matrices.

6. **Backtracking:**
   - Explore all possible solutions by making and unmaking choices.
   - Useful for constraint satisfaction problems like permutations, combinations, and puzzles.

7. **Greedy Algorithm:**
   - Make the locally optimal choice at each step with the hope of finding a global optimum.
   - Useful for optimization problems involving sorting or selection.

8. **Hashing:**
   - Use hash tables to store and lookup values efficiently.
   - Useful for problems involving quick access and retrieval of data.

### Tips for Efficient Problem Solving

1. **Understand the Problem Statement:**
   - Read the problem statement carefully.
   - Identify the input, output, and constraints.

2. **Plan Your Approach:**
   - Think about the possible ways to solve the problem.
   - Consider the time and space complexity of each approach.

3. **Write Pseudocode:**
   - Outline your solution in pseudocode before coding.
   - Helps in organizing your thoughts and identifying potential issues.

4. **Test Your Solution:**
   - Test your code with different inputs, including edge cases.
   - Ensure that your solution handles all possible scenarios.

5. **Optimize Your Code:**
   - Look for ways to improve the efficiency of your solution.
   - Consider alternative data structures or algorithms if needed.
